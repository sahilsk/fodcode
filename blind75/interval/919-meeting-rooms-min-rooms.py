Description
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.)

(0,8),(8,10) is not conflict at 8


Example1
Input: intervals = [(0,30),(5,10),(15,20)]
Output: 2
Explanation:
We need two meeting rooms
room1: (0,30)
room2: (5,10),(15,20)


Example2
Input: intervals = [(2,7)]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Only need one meeting room
-------------------------
Solution
- keep track of #of meeting at given time by iteratring through two arrays, sorted Start and sorted End 
- counter++  if start < end, else counter --
- Run it till start array is finished. We don't have to worry about decrement meetings 
- Take the maximum of #counter value at any moment of time
